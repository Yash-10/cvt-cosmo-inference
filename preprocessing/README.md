- Files `analyze_density_fields_pspec_512grid.ipynb` and `analyze_density_fields_pspec_64grid.ipynb` were used for some preliminary internal analyses. These notebooks primarily visualize some example density maps with different cosmological parameters, plot their power spectra, and compare them with those that already came from the QUIJOTE simulation data for consistency checks.
- As the data access page says here: https://quijote-simulations.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access.html, some data may be temporarily unavailable. So, the paths in the `create_density_fields.ipynb` notebook may not exist now; that's what I found.
